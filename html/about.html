                <div>Hello! Thank you for visiting our site in it's first release. We still have a lot of content in the works. The most important to do on our list is replacing the current static map with an interactive one, to make the site the best possible resource for SoT island tracking. Beyond that we want to add more content per island, including additional information, filters and photos. Lastly, we have a couple of really exciting things in the works that we don't want to talk too much about until they're ready. If you have suggestions for future content or have run into any bugs we are eager for your feedback! The best place to reach us is at sotpirates@gmail.com</div>
